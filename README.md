Artemis lang is a quite outdated yet immensely practical scripting language I had made to translate the scripting language into checks, which works flawlessly and does not cause any intermediate lag. It's all locally cached into a check. It however won't sustain long on a larger scaled network. Keep in mind it loads an entire file per check per player. It's a nono in my book.
